# me-max-kicad
KiCAD template for the board that fits into Phoenix Contact ME-MAX housing

## Use

Simple create a new project in KiCAD then copy `*.sch` and `*.kicad_pcb` to project directory, rename them to match the project name.

Also copy `*.kicad_mod` to here you save your custom footprints (those are the connectors on both sides of the board).
